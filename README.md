Vedum Filter
================================
A Chrome extension that removes Norwegian populist politician Trygve Slagsvold Vedum from the Internet.

The filter is wholly based on the Trump Filter created by Rob Spectre, available at:
https://github.com/RobSpectre/Trump-Filter.git

Overview
--------------------------
Tired after over four years of seeing Donald J. Trump on web sites every day,
the Norwegian public is now faced with the equally annoying local nationalist and
populist Trygve Slagsvold Vedum and his terrifying grin.

The only way to deflate Vedum's political star is through suffocation. Vedum
can only lose if we turn off the TV and reduce his internet presence.

Thus, the Vedum Filter is presented as part of the antidote for this toxic
candidacy. This Chrome extension will identify parts of a web page likely to
contain Vedum and erase them from your view.

Share with your friends and eliminate the only currency Vedum can spend to win:
brand recognition.


Features
--------------------------

* Detects instances of Vedum on web pages, warning users of the horror they may contain.
* Attempts to identify semantically sections of the page likely to contain Vedum and removes them from the page.
* Sensitivity settings to customize the aggressiveness of the filter - remove single references, chunks or the entire page.


Installation (for Users)
--------------------------

Just install the extension from [the Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lhondapiaknegjpellpodegmeonigjic)!

Then surf the web, comforted by the protection you are now afforded.
